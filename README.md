# OpenAI API Excel integration

Goal was to create an In-house AI assistent for Excel to be used in the Crowe Case Study Competition by Team- To Peach Their Own (2023)


This repository contains an example OpenAI API integration for Excel. It allows users to query the API to automatically generate Excel tables about topics.


The integration is an Excel TaskPane Add-in, which is structured as an HTML / CSS / Javascript web app running in an iframe. See the following links for more info:

- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/excel/excel-add-ins-core-concepts

## Setup

Add your OpenAI API key and organization at the top of `excel-addin/src/taskpane.js` (search for `***KEY HERE***` and `***ORG HERE***`)

To start the local development server from the `excel-addin` directory:
- `brew install node@12` (Node LTS)
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev-server`

Open Excel for the web. Click "Insert" Menu (Ribbon) > Click "Office Add-ins" > Click "Upload My Add-in" in the upper right corner > Select `excel-addin/manifest.xml` ([source](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/testing/sideload-office-add-ins-for-testing#sideload-an-office-add-in-in-office-on-the-web))

You should see a new "OpenAI API" command group on the "Home" ribbon; click the "Tabulate" button to open the sidebar with API commands
